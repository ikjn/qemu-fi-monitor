Changelog for qemu-linaro
=========================

Note that this changelog only covers ARM-related changes
since the previous qemu-linaro release; since we track
upstream fairly closely there will be various upstream
changes which we incorporate but which are not listed
here. For full change detail consult the git history:

Bug numbers refer to Launchpad qemu-linaro bugs, eg:
https://bugs.launchpad.net/qemu-linaro/+bug/703094

version 2012.05:
 - Fixes #978694: Beagle bootrom emulation now correctly handles
   FAT12/FAT16 images (thanks to Peter Chubb for the bug report
   and patch).
 - We now support running ARM BE8 userspace binaries (ie
   byte-invariant big-endian data and little-endian code).

version 2012.04:
 - Fixes #928432: compiling spice support for i386 should
   no longer give compile warnings/errors.
 - Fixes #953544: 'SETEND' in Thumb mode should now UNDEF,
   in line with the behaviour for the ARM encoding.
 - Fixes #956799: add support for the ppoll syscall for
   ARM linux-user emulation.
 - Fixes #970252: add the OMAP36xx UART FIFO status registers
   (thanks to Jan Vesely for the bug report and patch).

version 2012.03:
 - Fixes #932856: the OMAP3 boot rom emulation now tries
   sector 256 in raw mode as well as sector 0.
 - Fixes #931940: the PL031 RTC model now correctly raises
   interrupts when the alarm timer expires.
 - Fixes #928555: compiling on ARM systems with GLib 2.31
   or better now works (we were previously failing due to
   deprecation warnings on thread API functions).
 - Fixes #885239: booting Linux on models using XScale CPUs
   now works (a regression from upstream QEMU which has always
   been present in qemu-linaro).
 - Fixes #928432: compilation failures due to warnings in
   Spice code on 32 bit hosts.
 - Fixes #906922: we now default to enabling 'reserve memory
   for guest' on 64 bit hosts in linux-user-mode. This
   significantly reduces the chances of QEMU being unable to
   satisfy a guest process mmap() request.
 - Fixes #947888: the emulation of /proc/self/maps has been
   improved. In particular the check for "%n in a format string
   must be in a read-only area of memory" in the glibc in Ubuntu
   Precise will now pass rather than always failing. (This was
   causing some invocations of gpg to fail which in turn meant
   using live-build to create Linaro images was failing.)
   (Thanks to Alexander Graf of SuSE for these fixes.)
 - QEMU's built-in boot loader now supports passing a device
   tree blob to the kernel: if you boot with -kernel mykernel
   (and optionally -initrd myinitrd) you can now also use the
   new command line option -dtb my.dtb to pass a device tree.
 - This version includes an initial implementation of a model
   of the Samsung Exynos4210 SoC, used by board models 'nuri' and
   'smdkc210' (thanks to Evgeny Voevodin, Maksim Kozlov, Igor
   Mitsyanko and Dmitry Solodkiy from Samsung, who submitted this
   work to upstream QEMU).
 - This version includes an initial implementation of a model
   of the Calxeda Highbank SoC, used by board model 'highbank'
   (thanks to Rob Herring and Mark Langsdorf of Calxeda, who
   submitted this work to upstream QEMU).

version 2012.02:
 - Fixes #926102: prctl(PR_SET_NAME, ...) not supported.  Fixes
   usermode qemu running some perl scripts (as of perl 5.14).
 - Fixes #913925: cpsie f instruction not reflected in FAULTMASK
   (M profile)
 - Simplified Cortex-A15 CPU definition, which can boot Linux.

version 2012.01:
 - Fixes #883133: we no longer assert on startup when running on
   ARM systems with brk address space randomization enabled
 - Fixes #870990: compiling on ARM systems for Thumb2 with
   --enable-debug now works
 - Fixes #903239: usermode emulation now includes support for
   various previously missing *xattr syscalls
 - Fixes #905697: trying to enable the prefetch engine in the
   OMAP GPMC model might trigger an assertion failure
 - We now have a (dummy) model of the L2x0/PL310 L2 cache
   controller (thanks to Rob Herring and Mark Langsdorf)

version 2011.12:
 - There are no Linaro-specific changes of note in this release

version 2011.11:
 - The ARM vexpress-a9, versatilepb, versatileab and realview-*
   boards now have audio support (thanks to Mathieu Sonet who
   contributed a PL041 implementation upstream)
 - Support for multiple instances of the "-sd" option on the
   command line has been dropped; this was never present in
   upstream QEMU and has been removed for consistency. Use
   "-drive,if=sd,index=N,file=file.img" for N=0,1,2... instead
 - Fixes #886980: 8 and 16 bit reads from the OMAP GPIO module
   would crash due to an infinite recursion

version 2011.10:
 - Beagle models now support USB networking (run the model with
   "-usb -device usb-net,netdev=mynet -netdev user,id=mynet")
 - Instructions introduced with the Cortex-A15 (ARM mode
   SDIV and UDIV, and the VFPv4 fused multiply-accumulate
   instructions VFMA, VFMS, VFNMA, VFNMS) are now supported
   in linux-user mode
 - Fixes a bug which would cause returning of the wrong NaN values
   in some cases (when more than one input is a NaN or when the
   "default NaN" should be returned)

version 2011.09:
 - linux-user mode now supports the 64 bit cmpxchg kernel helpers
   (only needed for applications compiled for ARMv6 or lower)
 - correct a bug which would cause a crash trying to use USB
   on the n800 and n810 models
 - PL111 display controller now supported; this fixes a problem
   where BGR was interpreted as RGB on recent versatilepb kernels
 - Compilation failures on SPARC, ARM, ia64 fixed

version 2011.08:
 - Fixes #816791: ARMv6 cp15 barrier instructions now work
   in linux-user mode as well as system mode
 - Support for ARM1176JZF-S core has been added (thanks to
   Jamie Iles <jamie@jamieiles.com>)
 - Add workaround for kernel bug #727781 (which has resurfaced
   in 3.0) to suppress warnings about bad-width omap i2c accesses

version 2011.07:
 - Fixes a compile failure on ia64 hosts
 - Fixes #728630: syscall 369 (prlimit64) implemented in
   linux-user mode
 - Fixes #802228: fix an ELF loader bug that caused problems
   with binaries generated by the Google Go compiler

version 2011.06:
 - Introduces a model of the Gumstix Overo board ("overo")
 - Fixes #708703: the OMAP3 OHCI USB controller is implemented
   and works for USB keyboard and mouse
 - Fixes #768650: suppresses a "Bad register 0x000000f8"
   warning caused by the Linux kernel deliberately accessing
   a non-existent OMAP3 interrupt controller register
 - Models a DDC I2C slave to pass fake EDID monitor data,
   to satisfy Linux kernels which insist on probing for a
   monitor before turning on the display
 - Fixes overflow when calculating result of signed VABAL
 - Fixes handling of Neon UNDEF cases
 - Fixes setting of floating point exception flags for
   various Neon and VFP instructions
 - Fixes corruption of base register for an abort midway
   through a Thumb LDM which includes the base register in
   the set of registers to be loaded

version 2011.04-1:
 - Fixes a compilation failure with gcc 4.5

version 2011.04-0:
 - Fixes #731095: compiling for an ARM host in Thumb mode
   now works (QEMU no longer segfaults on startup)
 - Fixes #731279: compilation failures on SPARC Lucid fixed
 - Some minor fixes to Neon corner cases (correctly handle
   some UNDEF patterns, generate correct results for
   VABAL, handle denormals and NaNs correctly in Neon floating
   point arithmetic)

version 2011.03-1:
 - Fixes #731093: models with a PL181 (including vexpress-a9,
   versatilepb and realview) would crash unless an SD card
   image was specified for each PL181

version 2011.03-0:

 - Introduces a model of the ARM Versatile Express with
   Cortex-A9MPx4 daughterboard ("vexpress-a9")
 - Fixes #644961: linux-user mode now supports epoll syscalls
 - Fixes #721801: linux-user mode llseek on 64 bit hosts no longer
   truncates the returned  seek position to 32 bits
 - Fixes #714600: OMAP3 UARTs now handle the extensions beyond
   16550A compatibility; in particular Linux images using the
   omap-hsuart driver can now boot to a shell prompt
 - Fixes #714606: an SD card model bug was causing spurious
   "not in Sending-Data state" messages on OMAP3
 - Fixes #716336: should now compile on SPARC
 - Fixes #713101: the OMAP3 MMC model no longer causes Linux
   to hang if it tries to enable a swapfile
 - Has a number of minor ARM instruction correctness fixes
 - Partial fix for #728630: linux-user mode now has a dummy
   implementation of prlimit64 to silence the warnings when
   running newer versions of apt, pending a proper implementation
   of this syscall.
